# ExamCorrector

According to a 2017 report published by the Irish Independant, 48 teachers are required to correct the 2017 CSPE Junior Cert examinations. Only 28 teachers were actually available to mark the exams. According to the Independent this was due to the low pay rates for teachers correcting State examinations. My projects solution is to create a method for CSPE examinations to be corrected by a computer in a clever, dynamic way.
